# Crop Yield and Weather Data

In this repo, we compare the crop yield of corn to the weather data for various weather stations around the midwest.

## Run Instructions:


Choose a directory with weather station files called `<weather_dir>`
Choose a directory containing the crop yield file called `<yield_dir>`

To launch the program use
```
python3 weatherprocessor.py <weather_dir> <yield_dir>
```
For example, use

```
python3 weatherprocessor.py ./DataSciTest/wx_data/ ./DataSciTest/yld_data/
```
